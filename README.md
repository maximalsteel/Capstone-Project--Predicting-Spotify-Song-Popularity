### Project Title: **Predicting Spotify Song Popularity**

#### **Overview**
This project develops a machine learning model to predict song popularity on Spotify using audio features and metadata. By analyzing attributes such as danceability, energy, and genre, the model categorizes songs into popularity bins, helping artists and record labels optimize marketing strategies and improve promotional efforts.

#### **Methodology**
1. **Business Understanding:** Aim to create a predictive model for song popularity to aid in music promotion and playlist placement.
2. **Data Collection:** Used a dataset from Kaggle and Spotify Web API with 114,472 records and 21 features.
3. **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and dropped irrelevant columns.
4. **EDA:** Analyzed feature distributions, correlations, and categorical data to uncover patterns.
5. **Feature Engineering:** Applied encoding methods and handled outliers.
6. **Modeling:** Utilized RandomForestClassifier with an accuracy of 0.73 for predicting popularity categories.
7. **Deployment:** Developed a Gradio app for interactive predictions based on the trained model.
